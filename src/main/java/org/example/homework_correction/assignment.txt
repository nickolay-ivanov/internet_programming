Task Description:
We are building a multi-client chat server where multiple clients can connect to a server and send messages to each other. The server should broadcast any message received from one client to all other connected clients.Each client must first register with a unique username before they can join the chat. Once registered, they can send and receive messages.

Requirements:
Server: The server should be able to handle multiple clients concurrently (multi-threaded) and broadcast any message received from one client to all the other clients.
Server: It will maintain a list of registered users. Each client must first register with a unique username before sending or receiving messages.
Client: Each client can send messages to the server, and they should receive messages from other connected clients in real-time.
Client: Each client must first register by providing a username. After that, they can start chatting.
Username Validation: The server will ensure that no two clients have the same username.(users can be stored in memory)
Exit Mechanism: Clients can type "exit" to disconnect from the server.
